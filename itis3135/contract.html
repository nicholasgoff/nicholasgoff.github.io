                I, Nicholas J. Goff agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
                SEMESTER 2025, ITIS3135, Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
                As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online 
                or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
                I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, 
                and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
                (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. 
                Signed: Nicholas J. Goff , 04/02/2025</p>
